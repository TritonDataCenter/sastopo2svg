Tool to generate an interactive SVG from the serialized (XML) representation of the SAS topology.

The serialize topology is generated by running the ```smartos``` SmartOS tool as follows:

```
# /usr/lib/fm/fmd/sastopo -x
```

**NOTE**: The sastopo tool is only available in the development "sastopo" branch of git://github.com/TritonDataCenter/illumos-joyent.
